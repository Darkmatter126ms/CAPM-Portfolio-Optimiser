# CAPM-Portfolio-Optimiser
This project bridges foundational finance theory and coding by estimating CAPM beta for individual stocks through regression analysis. Afterwards,
we explore an optimal portfolio based on mean-variance optimisation (Markowitz framework), using historical return and covariance data. Lastly, risk
metrics calculation, tackling optimisation problems with constraints, and visualise efficient frontiers to explore risk-return tradeoffs.

## Results
Three optimisation methods are explored:
1) Equal weight, where all stocks are given equal weightage. The most naive method performed surprisingly well in terms of raw returns.
2) Min-variance minimises the risk (volatility), but sacrifices on return.
3) Max-Sharpe offers the greatest return adjusted for per unit risk.
